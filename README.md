## Installing and using Ymir

You can use Ymir in two ways:

- as a library in your project or 

- using pre-made scripts for the most common tasks - computation of generation probabilities,
estimation of parameters of an assembling model from the experimental data or
generation of pre-selected immune receptor sequences. For this tasks you need to compile
some source code, but don't worry! It's very easy, just look at the next subsection. After compiling,
take a look at the `Examples / ready-to-use scripts` section where pre-made scripts are explained in details.

### Compiling Ymir

Dependencies:

- [Python 3](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

- [JsonCPP](https://github.com/open-source-parsers/jsoncpp)

- [MPFR (non-necessary due to license)]()

assembling / generation

Targets: scripts, tests, benchmarking, lib

### Using Ymir as a library

Ymir is a header only library

For using only the core data structure MAAG and MAAGBuilder use:

    #include <Ymir/Graph>

For computing and generation from files:

    #include <Ymir/Model>

For statistical inference of parameters:

    #include <Ymir/Inference>

For super secret unimplemented things:
    
    #include <Ymir/Pattern>

wow-wow, easy here. There are not implemented yet.
